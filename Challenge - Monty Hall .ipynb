    "My intuition says that whether you stick with your original choice or not, you have a 50% chance of winning the car. However, after reading the wiki page on the Monty Hall Problem, I know that is not the case, as this is conditional probability and not independent. \n",
    "\n",
    "So there are three different scenarios in which the person can win the car: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. goat behind doors 1 and 2\n",
    "2. goat behind doors 1 and 3 \n",
    "3. goat behind doors 2 and 3 \n",
    "\n",
    "In two of the scenarios, if the contestant switches his/her answer, the probability is 2/3 of him/her winning the car. Therefore, it makes sense to switch the answer. \n",
    "\n",
    "Bayes Rule comes into affect here as this is a conditional probability problem. We want to know what's the probability of winning the car after after switching answers given that the host picked a dud. "
